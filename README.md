# Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning models to train for optimal precision and recall
Repo contains the Machine Learning Project on cancer prediction which can classify whether the person has cancer and is trained for high recall and high precision. The dataset used for the project can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIP-BITS/BITS-DATA/main/cancer.csv. This project helps us identify the malignant case by using various machine learning models like SVM and Decision Trees while me make the final decision to use the best model out of these based on precision and recall scores.

The dataset contains various features like mean_radius and mean_width based on which our model would make the prediction as to whether a person has cancer or not.
